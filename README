rdate
-----

rdate connects to an RFC 868 time server over a TCP/IP network,
printing the returned time and/or setting the system clock.

A time protocol server is built into most inetd implementations.

This version uses protocol indenpendent socket code - so will work
for IPv4 and IPv6 hosts, but may not compile on older systems.


This version of rdate is released under the 
GNU Public Licence - see COPYING for details.
